                        <br>

                        The Internship through "Maxx Power" has given me an opportunity to understand and explore different aspects of a website building team such as:<br>
                        <br>
                          Data Management Team<br>
                          Website Building Team<br>
                          Security Analysts Team<br>
                          <br>
                        In the Past, I have made many websites from Websites for personal usage to Websites for Friends and Family.<br>

                      <p>For the Data Management Team, I had taken up the leader position like I had done in the past. <br>
                        We had split up the work between us to figure out the best outcomes for our team. We had split up years of the date codes on the Data. By doing this, the efficiency was maximized<br>
                        <br>
                        I had split up the work from 2010 - 2019 and I had created 3 out of the 4 IFrames.<br>

                      We had split up the work between us to figure out the best outcomes for our team. This system did not work out in the end though. Most team mates were confused, so two teammates ended up doing alot of the work for this website (creating and formatting)<br>
                      <br>
                      I had created the Website and Major CSS files.<br>

                    I had created the protocols (Man In The Middle, DDOS, MALWARE) and had explained how to prevent Malware.<br>

                <br>
                Go to College after High School at UVA or Virginia Tech to pursue my Finance and Computer Science Degree, then go further in my career and attend UVA for Graduate School. 
                Graduate School will either include my Law Degree or Medical Degree.  --- future is still uncertain<br>
                <br>
                Decide to go to work after High School at A Technology Agency --- future is still uncertain<br>
